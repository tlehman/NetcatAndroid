# netcat for Android

In order to learn the Android SDK, I wanted to make the simplest thing that could possibly connect two computers (including phones,tablets, etc.)

At the root of every network program is at least one socket, this app has one stream socket, you pick a port and a destination address, and then enter some data and hit send:

Please leave hateful comments on the code, lambasting me for my poor style and lack of aesthetic sophistication.

Todo:
 - Implement listen mode
 - Enable non-text data transfer
